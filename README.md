cover the power of natural language processing (NLP) with projects centered around news classification.
Text Classification:
Text classification is the task of assigning predefined categories or labels to textual data based on its content. It is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) for tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization, and more.

Steps in Text Classification:

Tokenization: Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units, typically words or subwords (tokens). This step involves splitting the text into individual tokens, which serve as the basic units of analysis for subsequent processing.

Stemming: Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form. It involves removing suffixes or prefixes from words to normalize them and reduce variations. For example, "running," "runs," and "runner" may all be stemmed to the base form "run."

Stopword Removal: Stopwords are common words that often appear frequently in text but carry little semantic meaning (e.g., "the," "is," "and"). Stopword removal involves filtering out these irrelevant words from the text to improve the quality of analysis and reduce noise.

Vectorization: Vectorization is the process of converting textual data into numerical vectors that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. This step typically involves techniques such as bag-of-words (BoW), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings to represent the text in a high-dimensional vector space.

Splitting of Data: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the classifier, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance during training, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

Classifier Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm for the task at hand. In this case, we'll discuss logistic regression and passive aggressive classifier.

Classifiers:

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a linear classification algorithm commonly used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic (sigmoid) function. Logistic regression is simple, interpretable, and well-suited for text classification tasks, especially when the feature space is relatively small.

Passive Aggressive Classifier: The passive aggressive classifier is a type of online learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for text classification tasks with large feature spaces. It updates its model parameters in an aggressive manner when it makes mistakes on training instances and remains passive when predictions are correct. This makes it efficient for handling streaming data and adapting to changing environments.
